Assignment Task

At Pratilipi, we call one story as pratilipi. Attached is a data set containing user_id, pratilipi_id, date. This denotes which user has read which story on a particular date. The data set is provided.

1. Can you build a model using the data set and predict which pratilipis (atleast 5), each user is going to read later?

2. Arrange the dataset in ascending order of time, use the first 75% of the data for training and evaluate your model on the next 25% of the data.

Note: It is recommended to run the notebook and not the python file.
